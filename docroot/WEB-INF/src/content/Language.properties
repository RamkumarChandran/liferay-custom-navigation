customNavigationSites-help-text-paragraph1-x=For proper use of the "Custom Navigation Sites" Plugin, enter all site ids that should have their navigation included in this site's top level navigation (one site-id per line). On the public pages of this site, all the public pages of the other site will be shown (provided the proper access permissions)
customNavigationSites-help-text-paragraph2-x=If you include the current site's id ({0}) in the list, its pages will be shown at the position you choose. If you don't include it in the list, the current site's pages will be shown before the sites that you list here - so that you never get completely lost.
