customNavigationSites-help-headline=Note for Custom Navigation Sites
customNavigationSites-help-text-paragraph1-x=For proper use of the "Custom Navigation Sites" Plugin, enter all site ids that should have their navigation included in this site's top level navigation (one site-id per line), followed by either a comma, then either <i>public</i> or <i>private</i> (no spaces!) - e.g. <i>10820,public</i> is a valid line. 
customNavigationSites-help-text-paragraph2-x=If you include the current site's id ({0}) in the list, its pages will be shown at the position you choose. If you don't include it in the list, the current site's pages will be shown before the sites that you list here - so that you never get completely lost.
